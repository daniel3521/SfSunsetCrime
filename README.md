# A Quick Analysis of Crime in the Sunset District of San Francisco 

## Introduction 
Growing up in San Francisco is something I take great pride in but nothing is ever perfect. I never considered my neighborhood, the Sunset district, dangerous but the past couple years my friends and I have been wondering if our neighborhood has had more crime in recent years. The SFPD has published a dataset of their crime reports going back to the early 2000's on datasf.org so I decided use my SQL skills and take a look through their giant dataset. The dataset was imported to a MySQL database where I was able to efficiently go through the data and extracted data was visualized in Tablueau.
